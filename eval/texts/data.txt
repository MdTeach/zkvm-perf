Parsing, syntax analysis, or syntactic analysis is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar. The term parsing comes from Latin pars (orationis), meaning part (of speech).[1]

The term has slightly different meanings in different branches of linguistics and computer science. Traditional sentence parsing is often performed as a method of understanding the exact meaning of a sentence or word, sometimes with the aid of devices such as sentence diagrams. It usually emphasizes the importance of grammatical divisions such as subject and predicate.

Within computational linguistics the term is used to refer to the formal analysis by a computer of a sentence or other string of words into its constituents, resulting in a parse tree showing their syntactic relation to each other, which may also contain semantic information.[citation needed] Some parsing algorithms generate a parse forest or list of parse trees from a string that is syntactically ambiguous.[2]

The term is also used in psycholinguistics when describing language comprehension. In this context, parsing refers to the way that human beings analyze a sentence or phrase (in spoken language or text) "in terms of grammatical constituents, identifying the parts of speech, syntactic relations, etc."[1] This term is especially common when discussing which linguistic cues help speakers interpret garden-path sentences.

Within computer science, the term is used in the analysis of computer languages, referring to the syntactic analysis of the input code into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters. The term may also be used to describe a split or separation.

Human languages
Main category: Natural language parsing
Traditional methods
The traditional grammatical exercise of parsing, sometimes known as clause analysis, involves breaking down a text into its component parts of speech with an explanation of the form, function, and syntactic relationship of each part.[3] This is determined in large part from study of the language's conjugations and declensions, which can be quite intricate for heavily inflected languages. To parse a phrase such as "man bites dog" involves noting that the singular noun "man" is the subject of the sentence, the verb "bites" is the third person singular of the present tense of the verb "to bite", and the singular noun "dog" is the object of the sentence. Techniques such as sentence diagrams are sometimes used to indicate relation between elements in the sentence.

Parsing was formerly central to the teaching of grammar throughout the English-speaking world, and widely regarded as basic to the use and understanding of written language. However, the general teaching of such techniques is no longer current.[citation needed]

In some machine translation and natural language processing systems, written texts in human languages are parsed by computer programs.[4] Human sentences are not easily parsed by programs, as there is substantial ambiguity in the structure of human language, whose usage is to convey meaning (or semantics) amongst a potentially unlimited range of possibilities, but only some of which are germane to the particular case.[5] So an utterance "Man bites dog" versus "Dog bites man" is definite on one detail but in another language might appear as "Man dog bites" with a reliance on the larger context to distinguish between those two possibilities, if indeed that difference was of concern. It is difficult to prepare formal rules to describe informal behaviour even though it is clear that some rules are being followed.[citation needed]

In order to parse natural language data, researchers must first agree on the grammar to be used. The choice of syntax is affected by both linguistic and computational concerns; for instance some parsing systems use lexical functional grammar, but in general, parsing for grammars of this type is known to be NP-complete. Head-driven phrase structure grammar is another linguistic formalism which has been popular in the parsing community, but other research efforts have focused on less complex formalisms such as the one used in the Penn Treebank. Shallow parsing aims to find only the boundaries of major constituents such as noun phrases. Another popular strategy for avoiding linguistic controversy is dependency grammar parsing.

Most modern parsers are at least partly statistical; that is, they rely on a corpus of training data which has already been annotated (parsed by hand). This approach allows the system to gather information about the frequency with which various constructions occur in specific contexts. (See machine learning.) Approaches which have been used include straightforward PCFGs (probabilistic context-free grammars),[6] maximum entropy,[7] and neural nets.[8] Most of the more successful systems use lexical statistics (that is, they consider the identities of the words involved, as well as their part of speech). However such systems are vulnerable to overfitting and require some kind of smoothing to be effective.[citation needed]

Parsing algorithms for natural language cannot rely on the grammar having 'nice' properties as with manually designed grammars for programming languages. As mentioned earlier some grammar formalisms are very difficult to parse computationally; in general, even if the desired structure is not context-free, some kind of context-free approximation to the grammar is used to perform a first pass. Algorithms which use context-free grammars often rely on some variant of the CYK algorithm, usually with some heuristic to prune away unlikely analyses to save time. (See chart parsing.) However some systems trade speed for accuracy using, e.g., linear-time versions of the shift-reduce algorithm. A somewhat recent development has been parse reranking in which the parser proposes some large number of analyses, and a more complex system selects the best option.[citation needed] In natural language understanding applications, semantic parsers convert the text into a representation of its meaning.[9]

Psycholinguistics
In psycholinguistics, parsing involves not just the assignment of words to categories (formation of ontological insights), but the evaluation of the meaning of a sentence according to the rules of syntax drawn by inferences made from each word in the sentence (known as connotation). This normally occurs as words are being heard or read.

Neurolinguistics generally understands parsing to be a function of working memory, meaning that parsing is used to keep several parts of one sentence at play in the mind at one time, all readily accessible to be analyzed as needed. Because the human working memory has limitations, so does the function of sentence parsing.[10] This is evidenced by several different types of syntactically complex sentences that propose potentially issues for mental parsing of sentences.

The first, and perhaps most well-known, type of sentence that challenges parsing ability is the garden-path sentence. These sentences are designed so that the most common interpretation of the sentence appears grammatically faulty, but upon further inspection, these sentences are grammatically sound. Garden-path sentences are difficult to parse because they contain a phrase or a word with more than one meaning, often their most typical meaning being a different part of speech.[11] For example, in the sentence, "the horse raced past the barn fell", raced is initially interpreted as a past tense verb, but in this sentence, it functions as part of an adjective phrase.[12] Since parsing is used to identify parts of speech, these sentences challenge the parsing ability of the reader.

Another type of sentence that is difficult to parse is an attachment ambiguity, which includes a phrase that could potentially modify different parts of a sentence, and therefore presents a challenge in identifying syntactic relationship (i.e. "The boy saw the lady with the telescope", in which the ambiguous phrase with the telescope could modify the boy saw or the lady.) [11]

A third type of sentence that challenges parsing ability is center embedding, in which phrases are placed in the center of other similarly formed phrases (i.e. "The rat the cat the man hit chased ran into the trap".) Sentences with 2 or in the most extreme cases 3 center embeddings are challenging for mental parsing, again because of ambiguity of syntactic relationship.[13]

Within neurolinguistics there are multiple theories that aim to describe how parsing takes place in the brain. One such model is a more traditional generative model of sentence processing, which theorizes that within the brain there is a distinct module designed for sentence parsing, which is preceded by access to lexical recognition and retrieval, and then followed by syntactic processing that considers a single syntactic result of the parsing, only returning to revise that syntactic interpretation if a potential problem is detected.[14] The opposing, more contemporary model theorizes that within the mind, the processing of a sentence is not modular, or happening in strict sequence. Rather, it poses that several different syntactic possibilities can be considered at the same time, because lexical access, syntactic processing, and determination of meaning occur in parallel in the brain. In this way these processes are integrated.[15]

Although there is still much to learn about the neurology of parsing, studies have shown evidence that several areas of the brain might play a role in parsing. These include the left anterior temporal pole, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left superior temporal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus, the right posterior cingulate cortex, and the left angular gyrus. Although it has not been absolutely proven, it has been suggested that these different structures might favor either phrase-structure parsing or dependency-structure parsing, meaning different types of parsing could be processed in different ways which have yet to be understood.[16]

Parser
"Parser" redirects here. For the scripting language named Parser, see Parser (programming language).
A parser is a software component that takes input data (typically text) and builds a data structure – often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax. The parsing may be preceded or followed by other steps, or these may be combined into a single step. The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters; alternatively, these can be combined in scannerless parsing. Parsers may be programmed by hand or may be automatically or semi-automatically generated by a parser generator. Parsing is complementary to templating, which produces formatted output. These may be applied to different domains, but often appear together, such as the scanf/printf pair, or the input (front end parsing) and output (back end code generation) stages of a compiler.

The input to a parser is typically text in some computer language, but may also be text in a natural language or less structured textual data, in which case generally only certain parts of the text are extracted, rather than a parse tree being constructed. Parsers range from very simple functions such as scanf, to complex programs such as the frontend of a C++ compiler or the HTML parser of a web browser. An important class of simple parsing is done using regular expressions, in which a group of regular expressions defines a regular language and a regular expression engine automatically generating a parser for that language, allowing pattern matching and extraction of text. In other contexts regular expressions are instead used prior to parsing, as the lexing step whose output is then used by the parser.

The use of parsers varies by input. In the case of data languages, a parser is often found as the file reading facility of a program, such as reading in HTML or XML text; these examples are markup languages. In the case of programming languages, a parser is a component of a compiler or interpreter, which parses the source code of a computer programming language to create some form of internal representation; the parser is a key step in the compiler frontend. Programming languages tend to be specified in terms of a deterministic context-free grammar because fast and efficient parsers can be written for them. For compilers, the parsing itself can be done in one pass or multiple passes – see one-pass compiler and multi-pass compiler.

The implied disadvantages of a one-pass compiler can largely be overcome by adding fix-ups, where provision is made for code relocation during the forward pass, and the fix-ups are applied backwards when the current program segment has been recognized as having been completed. An example where such a fix-up mechanism would be useful would be a forward GOTO statement, where the target of the GOTO is unknown until the program segment is completed. In this case, the application of the fix-up would be delayed until the target of the GOTO was recognized. Conversely, a backward GOTO does not require a fix-up, as the location will already be known.

Context-free grammars are limited in the extent to which they can express all of the requirements of a language. Informally, the reason is that the memory of such a language is limited. The grammar cannot remember the presence of a construct over an arbitrarily long input; this is necessary for a language in which, for example, a name must be declared before it may be referenced. More powerful grammars that can express this constraint, however, cannot be parsed efficiently. Thus, it is a common strategy to create a relaxed parser for a context-free grammar which accepts a superset of the desired language constructs (that is, it accepts some invalid constructs); later, the unwanted constructs can be filtered out at the semantic analysis (contextual analysis) step.

For example, in Python the following is syntactically valid code:

x = 1;
print(x);
The following code, however, is syntactically valid in terms of the context-free grammar, yielding a syntax tree with the same structure as the previous, but violates the semantic rule requiring variables to be initialized before use:

x = 1
print(y)
Overview of process
Flow of data in a typical parser
The following example demonstrates the common case of parsing a computer language with two levels of grammar: lexical and syntactic.

The first stage is the token generation, or lexical analysis, by which the input character stream is split into meaningful symbols defined by a grammar of regular expressions. For example, a calculator program would look at an input such as "12 * (3 + 4)^2" and split it into the tokens 12, *, (, 3, +, 4, ), ^, 2, each of which is a meaningful symbol in the context of an arithmetic expression. The lexer would contain rules to tell it that the characters *, +, ^, ( and ) mark the start of a new token, so meaningless tokens like "12*" or "(3" will not be generated.

The next stage is parsing or syntactic analysis, which is checking that the tokens form an allowable expression. This is usually done with reference to a context-free grammar which recursively defines components that can make up an expression and the order in which they must appear. However, not all rules defining programming languages can be expressed by context-free grammars alone, for example type validity and proper declaration of identifiers. These rules can be formally expressed with attribute grammars.

The final phase is semantic parsing or analysis, which is working out the implications of the expression just validated and taking the appropriate action.[17] In the case of a calculator or interpreter, the action is to evaluate the expression or program; a compiler, on the other hand, would generate some kind of code. Attribute grammars can also be used to define these actions.

Types of parsers
The task of the parser is essentially to determine if and how the input can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar. This can be done in essentially two ways:

Top-down parsing
Top-down parsing can be viewed as an attempt to find left-most derivations of an input-stream by searching for parse trees using a top-down expansion of the given formal grammar rules. Tokens are consumed from left to right. Inclusive choice is used to accommodate ambiguity by expanding all alternative right-hand-sides of grammar rules.[18] This is known as the primordial soup approach. Very similar to sentence diagramming, primordial soup breaks down the constituencies of sentences.[19]
Bottom-up parsing
A parser can start with the input and attempt to rewrite it to the start symbol. Intuitively, the parser attempts to locate the most basic elements, then the elements containing these, and so on. LR parsers are examples of bottom-up parsers. Another term used for this type of parser is Shift-Reduce parsing.
LL parsers and recursive-descent parser are examples of top-down parsers that cannot accommodate left recursive production rules. Although it has been believed that simple implementations of top-down parsing cannot accommodate direct and indirect left-recursion and may require exponential time and space complexity while parsing ambiguous context-free grammars, more sophisticated algorithms for top-down parsing have been created by Frost, Hafiz, and Callaghan[20][21] which accommodate ambiguity and left recursion in polynomial time and which generate polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees. Their algorithm is able to produce both left-most and right-most derivations of an input with regard to a given context-free grammar.

An important distinction with regard to parsers is whether a parser generates a leftmost derivation or a rightmost derivation (see context-free grammar). LL parsers will generate a leftmost derivation and LR parsers will generate a rightmost derivation (although usually in reverse).[18]

Some graphical parsing algorithms have been designed for visual programming languages.[22][23] Parsers for visual languages are sometimes based on graph grammars.[24]

Adaptive parsing algorithms have been used to construct "self-extending" natural language user interfaces.[25]

Implementation
A simple parser implementation reads the entire input file, performs an intermediate computation or translation, and then writes the entire output file, such as in-memory multi-pass compilers.

Alternative parser implementation approaches:

push parsers call registered handlers (callbacks) as soon as the parser detects relevant tokens in the input stream. A push parser may skip parts of the input that are irrelevant (an example is Expat).
pull parsers, such as parsers that are typically used by compilers front-ends by "pulling" input text.
incremental parsers (such as incremental chart parsers) that, as the text of the file is edited by a user, does not need to completely re-parse the entire file.

C program that cannot be parsed with less than 2 token lookahead. Top: C grammar excerpt.[28] Bottom: a parser has digested the tokens "int v;main(){" and is about to choose a rule to derive Stmt. Looking only at the first lookahead token "v", it cannot decide which of both alternatives for Stmt to choose; the latter requires peeking at the second token.
Lookahead establishes the maximum incoming tokens that a parser can use to decide which rule it should use. Lookahead is especially relevant to LL, LR, and LALR parsers, where it is often explicitly indicated by affixing the lookahead to the algorithm name in parentheses, such as LALR(1).

Most programming languages, the primary target of parsers, are carefully defined in such a way that a parser with limited lookahead, typically one, can parse them, because parsers with limited lookahead are often more efficient. One important change[citation needed] to this trend came in 1990 when Terence Parr created ANTLR for his Ph.D. thesis, a parser generator for efficient LL(k) parsers, where k is any fixed value.

LR parsers typically have only a few actions after seeing each token. They are shift (add this token to the stack for later reduction), reduce (pop tokens from the stack and form a syntactic construct), end, error (no known rule applies) or conflict (does not know whether to shift or reduce).

Lookahead has two advantages.[clarification needed]

It helps the parser take the correct action in case of conflicts. For example, parsing the if statement in the case of an else clause.
It eliminates many duplicate states and eases the burden of an extra stack. A C language non-lookahead parser will have around 10,000 states. A lookahead parser will have around 300 states.
Example: Parsing the Expression 1 + 2 * 3[dubious – discuss]

Set of expression parsing rules (called grammar) is as follows,
Rule1:	E → E + E	Expression is the sum of two expressions.
Rule2:	E → E * E	Expression is the product of two expressions.
Rule3:	E → number	Expression is a simple number
Rule4:	+ has less precedence than *
Most programming languages (except for a few such as APL and Smalltalk) and algebraic formulas give higher precedence to multiplication than addition, in which case the correct interpretation of the example above is 1 + (2 * 3). Note that Rule4 above is a semantic rule. It is possible to rewrite the grammar to incorporate this into the syntax. However, not all such rules can be translated into syntax.

Simple non-lookahead parser actions
Initially Input = [1, +, 2, *, 3]

Shift "1" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [+, 2, *, 3] Stack = [1]
Reduces "1" to expression "E" based on rule3. Stack = [E]
Shift "+" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule1). Input = [2, *, 3] Stack = [E, +]
Shift "2" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [*, 3] Stack = [E, +, 2]
Reduce stack element "2" to Expression "E" based on rule3. Stack = [E, +, E]
Reduce stack items [E, +, E] and new input "E" to "E" based on rule1. Stack = [E]
Shift "*" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule2). Input = [3] Stack = [E,*]
Shift "3" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [] (empty) Stack = [E, *, 3]
Reduce stack element "3" to expression "E" based on rule3. Stack = [E, *, E]
Reduce stack items [E, *, E] and new input "E" to "E" based on rule2. Stack = [E]
The parse tree and resulting code from it is not correct according to language semantics.

To correctly parse without lookahead, there are three solutions:

The user has to enclose expressions within parentheses. This often is not a viable solution.
The parser needs to have more logic to backtrack and retry whenever a rule is violated or not complete. The similar method is followed in LL parsers.
Alternatively, the parser or grammar needs to have extra logic to delay reduction and reduce only when it is absolutely sure which rule to reduce first. This method is used in LR parsers. This correctly parses the expression but with many more states and increased stack depth.
Lookahead parser actions[clarification needed]
Shift 1 onto stack on input 1 in anticipation of rule3. It does not reduce immediately.
Reduce stack item 1 to simple Expression on input + based on rule3. The lookahead is +, so we are on path to E +, so we can reduce the stack to E.
Shift + onto stack on input + in anticipation of rule1.
Shift 2 onto stack on input 2 in anticipation of rule3.
Reduce stack item 2 to Expression on input * based on rule3. The lookahead * expects only E before it.
Now stack has E + E and still the input is *. It has two choices now, either to shift based on rule2 or reduction based on rule1. Since * has higher precedence than + based on rule4, we shift * onto stack in anticipation of rule2.
Shift 3 onto stack on input 3 in anticipation of rule3.
Reduce stack item 3 to Expression after seeing end of input based on rule3.
Reduce stack items E * E to E based on rule2.
Reduce stack items E + E to E based on rule1.
The parse tree generated is correct and simply more efficient[clarify][citation needed] than non-lookahead parsers. This is the strategy followed in LALR parsers.

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a free and open-source virtualization module in the Linux kernel that allows the kernel to function as a hypervisor. It was merged into the mainline Linux kernel in version 2.6.20, which was released on February 5, 2007.[1] KVM requires a processor with hardware virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT or AMD-V.[2] KVM has also been ported to other operating systems such as FreeBSD[3] and illumos[4] in the form of loadable kernel modules.

KVM was originally designed for x86 processors but has since been ported to ESA/390,[5] PowerPC,[6] IA-64, and ARM.[7][8] The IA-64 port was removed in 2014.[9]

KVM supports hardware-assisted virtualization for a wide variety of guest operating systems including BSD, Solaris, Windows, Haiku, ReactOS, Plan 9, AROS, macOS, and even other Linux systems.[10][11] In addition, Android 2.2, GNU/Hurd[12] (Debian K16), Minix 3.1.2a, Solaris 10 U3 and Darwin 8.0.1, together with other operating systems and some newer versions of these listed, are known to work with certain limitations.[13]

Additionally, KVM provides paravirtualization support for Linux, OpenBSD,[14] FreeBSD,[15] NetBSD,[16] Plan 9[17] and Windows guests using the VirtIO API.[18] This includes a paravirtual Ethernet card, disk I/O controller,[19] balloon driver, and a VGA graphics interface using SPICE or VMware drivers.

History
Avi Kivity began the development of KVM in mid-2006 at Qumranet, a technology startup company[20] that was acquired by Red Hat in 2008.[21]

KVM surfaced in October 2006[22] and was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.20, which was released on 5 February 2007.[1]

KVM is maintained by Paolo Bonzini.[23]

Internals

A high-level overview of the KVM/QEMU virtualization environment[24]: 3 
KVM provides device abstraction but no processor emulation. It exposes the /dev/kvm interface, which a user mode host can then use to:

Set up the guest VM's address space. The host must also supply a firmware image (usually a custom BIOS when emulating PCs) that the guest can use to bootstrap into its main OS.
Feed the guest simulated I/O.
Map the guest's video display back onto the system host.
Originally, a forked version of QEMU was provided to launch guests and deal with hardware emulation that is not handled by the kernel. That support was eventually merged into the upstream project. There are now numerous Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) which can utilise the KVM interface including kvmtool, crosvm and Firecracker and numerous specialised VMMs build with frameworks such as rust-vmm.

Internally, KVM uses SeaBIOS as an open source implementation of a 16-bit x86 BIOS.[25]

Features
KVM has had support for hot swappable vCPUs,[26] dynamic memory management,[27] and Live Migration since February 2007.[28][29] It also reduces the impact that memory write-intensive workloads have on the migration process.[30]

Emulated hardware
KVM itself emulates very little hardware, instead deferring to a higher level client application such as QEMU, crosvm, or Firecracker for device emulation.

KVM provides the following emulated devices:

Virtual CPU and memory[31]
VirtIO
Graphical management tools

libvirt supports KVM
Kimchi – web-based virtualization management tool for KVM
Virtual Machine Manager – supports creating, editing, starting, and stopping KVM-based virtual machines, as well as live or cold drag-and-drop migration of VMs between hosts.
Proxmox Virtual Environment – an open-source virtualization management package including KVM and LXC. It has a bare-metal installer, a web-based remote management GUI, a HA cluster stack, unified storage, flexible network, and optional commercial support.
OpenQRM – management platform for managing heterogeneous data center infrastructures
GNOME Boxes – Gnome interface for managing libvirt guests on Linux
oVirt – open-source virtualization management tool for KVM built on top of libvirt

Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC; sign: ₿) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Nodes in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network verify transactions through cryptography and record them in a public distributed ledger, called a blockchain, without central oversight. Consensus between nodes is achieved using a computationally intensive process based on proof of work, called mining, that guarantees the security of the bitcoin blockchain. Mining consumes large quantities of electricity and has been criticized for its environmental impact.[5]

Based on a free market ideology, bitcoin was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown person.[6] Use of bitcoin as a currency began in 2009,[7] with the release of its open-source implementation.[8]: ch. 1  In 2021, El Salvador adopted it as legal tender.[4] Bitcoin is currently used more as a store of value and less as a medium of exchange or unit of account. It is mostly seen as an investment and has been described by many scholars as an economic bubble.[9] As bitcoin is pseudonymous, its use by criminals has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to its ban by several countries as of 2021.[10]

History
Main article: History of bitcoin
Background
Before bitcoin, several digital cash technologies were released, starting with David Chaum's ecash in the 1980s.[11] The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992.[11] The concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997.[11] The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998.[12] In 2004, Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof of work.[13] These various attempts were not successful:[11] Chaum's concept required centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no protection against double-spending, while b-money and bit gold were not resistant to Sybil attacks.[11]

2008–2009: Creation
External image

Bitcoin logos made by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 (left) and 2010 (right).
The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008.[14] On 31 October 2008, a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[15] Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[7] Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.[6] All individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier academic literature.[11] Nakamoto's innovation was their complex interplay resulting in the first decentralized, Sybil resistant, Byzantine fault tolerant digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain.[11][16] Nakamoto's paper was not peer reviewed and was initially ignored by academics, who argued that it could not work.[11]

On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block.[17] Embedded in this block was the text "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks", which is the date and headline of an issue of The Times newspaper.[7] Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction: ten bitcoins from Nakamoto.[18] Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters.[17] On May 22, 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000, in what would later be celebrated as "Bitcoin Pizza Day".[19]

2010–2012: Early growth
Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins[20] before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation,[21][22] an organization founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin.[23]

After early "proof-of-concept" transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as the dark web Silk Road. During its 30 months of existence, beginning in February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting ₿9.9 million, worth about $214 million.[24]: 222 

2013–2014: First regulatory actions
In March 2013, the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for "decentralized virtual currencies" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as money services businesses, subject to registration and other legal obligations.[25] In May 2013, US authorities seized the unregistered exchange Mt. Gox.[26] In June 2013, the US Drug Enforcement Administration seized ₿11.02 from a man attempting to use them to buy illegal substances. This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoins.[27] The FBI seized about ₿30,000 in October 2013 from Silk Road, following the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht.[28]

In December 2013, the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoin.[29] After the announcement, the value of bitcoin dropped,[30] and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services.[31] Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least 2009.[32]

2015–2019
Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.[33] In August 2017, the SegWit software upgrade was activated. Segwit was intended to support the Lightning Network as well as improve scalability.[34] SegWit opponents, who supported larger blocks as a scalability solution, forked to create Bitcoin Cash, one of many forks of bitcoin.[35]

In December 2017, the first futures on bitcoin was introduced by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).[36]

In February 2018, the price crashed after China imposed a complete ban on Bitcoin trading.[37] The percentage of bitcoin trading in the Chinese renminbi fell from over 90% in September 2017 to less than 1% in June 2018.[38] During the same year, Bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges.[39]

2020–present

Bitcoin price in US dollars
In 2020, some major companies and institutions started to acquire bitcoin: MicroStrategy invested $250 million in bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,[40] Square, Inc., $50 million,[41] and MassMutual, $100 million.[42] In November 2020, PayPal added support for bitcoin in the US.[43]

In February 2021, Bitcoin's market capitalization reached $1 trillion for the first time.[44] In November 2021, the Taproot soft-fork upgrade was activated, adding support for Schnorr signatures, improved functionality of smart contracts and Lightning Network.[45] Before, Bitcoin only used a custom elliptic curve with the ECDSA algorithm to produce signatures.[46]: 101  In September 2021, Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador, alongside the US dollar.[4] In October 2021, the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), called BITO, from ProShares was approved by the SEC and listed on the CME.[47]

In May and June 2022, the bitcoin price fell following the collapses of TerraUSD, a stablecoin,[48] and the Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency loan company.[49][50]

In 2023, ordinals—non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—on Bitcoin, went live.[51] In January 2024, the first 11 US spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, offering direct exposure to bitcoin for the first time on American stock exchanges.[52][53] As of June 2023 River Financial estimated that Bitcoin had 81.7 million users, about 1% of the global population.[54]

Design
Main article: Bitcoin protocol
Units and divisibility
The unit of account of the bitcoin system is the bitcoin. It is most commonly represented with the symbol ₿[1] and the currency code BTC. However, the BTC code does not conform to ISO 4217 as BT is the country code of Bhutan,[55] and ISO 4217 requires the first letter used in global commodities to be 'X'.[55] XBT, a code that conforms to ISO 4217 though not officially part of it,[55] is used by Bloomberg L.P.[56]

No uniform capitalization convention exists; some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network, and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of account.[57] The Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary and the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary use the capitalized and lowercase variants without distinction.[58][59]

One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places.[8]: ch. 5  Units for smaller amounts of bitcoin are the millibitcoin (mBTC), equal to 1⁄1000 bitcoin, and the satoshi[a] (sat), representing 1⁄100000000 (one hundred millionth) bitcoin, the smallest amount possible.[2] 100,000 satoshis are one mBTC.[60]

Blockchain
Further information: Blockchain § Structure and design
As a decentralized system, bitcoin operates without a central authority or single administrator,[61] so that anyone can create a new bitcoin address and transact without needing any approval.[8]: ch. 1  This is accomplished through a specialized distributed ledger called a blockchain that records bitcoin transactions.[62]

The blockchain is implemented as an ordered list of blocks. Each block contains a SHA-256 hash of the previous block,[62] chaining them in chronological order.[8]: ch. 7 [62] The blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer network.[24]: 215–219  Individual blocks, public addresses, and transactions within blocks are public information, and can be examined using a blockchain explorer.[63]

Nodes validate and broadcast transactions, each maintaining a copy of the blockchain for ownership verification.[64] A new block is created every 10 minutes on average, updating the blockchain across all nodes without central oversight. This process tracks bitcoin spending, ensuring each bitcoin is spent only once. Unlike a traditional ledger that tracks physical currency, bitcoins exist digitally as unspent outputs of transactions.[8]: ch. 5 

Addresses and transactions

Simplified chain of ownership. In practice, a transaction can have more than one input and more than one output.[65]
In the blockchain, bitcoins are linked to specific addresses that are hashes of a public key. Creating an address involves generating a random private key and then computing the corresponding address. This process is almost instant, but the reverse (finding the private key for a given address) is nearly impossible.[8]: ch. 4  Publishing a bitcoin address does not risk its private key, and it is extremely unlikely to accidentally generate a used key with funds. To use bitcoins, owners need their private key to digitally sign transactions, which are verified by the network using the public key, keeping the private key secret.[8]: ch. 5 

Bitcoin transactions use a Forth-like scripting language,[8]: ch. 5  involving one or more inputs and outputs. When sending bitcoins, a user specifies the recipients' addresses and the amount for each output. This allows sending bitcoins to several recipients in a single transaction. To prevent double-spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain.[65] Using multiple inputs is similar to using multiple coins in a cash transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output can return the change back to the payer.[65] Unallocated input satoshis in the transaction become the transaction fee.[65]

Losing a private key means losing access to the bitcoins, with no other proof of ownership accepted by the protocol.[24] For instance, in 2013, a user lost ₿7,500, valued at US$7.5 million, by accidentally discarding a hard drive with the private key.[66] It is estimated that around 20% of all bitcoins are lost.[67] The private key must also be kept secret as its exposure, such as through a data breach, can lead to theft of the associated bitcoins.[8]: ch. 10 [68] As of December 2017, approximately ₿980,000 had been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges.[69]

Mining
See also: Bitcoin protocol § Mining

Bitcoin mining facility with large amounts of mining hardware
The mining process in Bitcoin involves maintaining the blockchain through computer processing power. Miners group and broadcast new transactions into blocks, which are then verified by the network.[62] Each block must contain a proof of work (PoW) to be accepted,[62] involving finding a nonce number that, combined with the block content, produces a hash numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target.[8]: ch. 8  This PoW is simple to verify but hard to generate, requiring many attempts.[8]: ch. 8  PoW forms the basis of Bitcoin's consensus mechanism.[70]

The difficulty of generating a block is deterministically adjusted based on the mining power on the network by changing the difficulty target, which is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks (approximately two weeks) to maintain an average time of ten minutes between new blocks. The process requires significant computational power and specialized hardware.[8]: ch. 8 [71]

Miners who successfully find a new block can collect transaction fees from the included transactions and a set reward in bitcoins.[72] To claim this reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included in the block, with the miner as the payee. All bitcoins in existence have been created through this type of transaction.[8]: ch. 8  This reward is halved every 210,000 blocks until ₿21 million,[b] with new bitcoin issuance slated to end around 2140. Afterward, miners will only earn from transaction fees. These fees are determined by the transaction's size and the amount of data stored, measured in satoshis per byte.[73][65][8]: ch. 8 

The proof of work system and the chaining of blocks make blockchain modifications very difficult, as altering one block requires changing all subsequent blocks. As more blocks are added, modifying older blocks becomes increasingly challenging.[74][62] In case of disagreement, nodes trust the longest chain, which required the greatest amount of effort to produce.[70] To tamper or censor the ledger, one needs to control the majority of the global hashrate.[70] The high cost required to reach this level of computational power guarantees the security of the bitcoin blockchain.[70]

Bitcoin mining's environmental impact is controversial and has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to restrictions or incentives in various jurisdictions.[75] As of 2022, a non-peer-reviewed study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) estimated that bitcoin mining represented 0.4% of global electricity consumption.[76] Another 2022 non-peer-reviewed commentary published in Joule estimated that bitcoin mining was responsible for 0.2% of world greenhouse gas emissions.[77] About half of the electricity used is generated through fossil fuels.[78] Moreover, mining hardware's short lifespan results in electronic waste.[79] The amount of electrical energy consumed, and the e-waste generated, is comparable to that of Greece and the Netherlands, respectively.[79][77]

Privacy and fungibility
Bitcoin is pseudonymous, with funds linked to addresses, not real-world identities. While the owners of these addresses are not directly identified, all transactions are public on the blockchain. Patterns of use, like spending coins from multiple inputs, can hint at a common owner. Public data can sometimes be matched with known address owners.[80] Bitcoin exchanges might also need to collect personal data as per legal requirements.[81] For enhanced privacy, users can generate a new address for each transaction.[82]

In the Bitcoin network, each bitcoin is treated equally, ensuring basic fungibility. However, users and applications can choose to differentiate between bitcoins. While wallets and software treat all bitcoins the same, each bitcoin's transaction history is recorded on the blockchain. This public record allows for chain analysis, where users can identify and potentially reject bitcoins from controversial sources.[83] For example, in 2012, Mt. Gox froze accounts containing bitcoins identified as stolen.[84]

Wallets
For broader coverage of this topic, see Cryptocurrency wallet.

A hardware wallet which processes bitcoin transactions without exposing private keys
Bitcoin wallets were the first cryptocurrency wallets, enabling users to store the information necessary to transact bitcoins.[85][8]: ch. 1, glossary  The first wallet program, simply named Bitcoin, and sometimes referred to as the Satoshi client, was released in 2009 by Nakamoto as open-source software.[7] Bitcoin Core is among the best known clients. Forks of Bitcoin Core exist such as Bitcoin Unlimited.[86] Wallets can be full clients, with a full copy of the blockchain to check the validity of mined blocks,[8]: ch. 1  or lightweight clients, just to send and receive transactions without a local copy of the entire blockchain.[87] Third-party internet services called online wallets store users' credentials on their servers, making them susceptible of hacks.[88] Cold storage protects bitcoins from such hacks by keeping private keys offline, either through specialized hardware wallets or paper printouts.[89][8]: ch. 4 

Scalability and decentralization challenges
Nakamoto limited the block size to one megabyte.[90] The limited block size and frequency can lead to delayed processing of transactions, increased fees and a Bitcoin scalability problem.[91] The Lightning Network, second-layer routing network, is a potential scaling solution.[8]: ch. 8 

Research shows a trend towards centralization in bitcoin as miners join pools for stable income.[24]: 215, 219–222 [92]: 3  If a single miner or pool controls more than 50% of the hashing power, it would allow them to censor transactions and double-spend coins.[61] In 2014, mining pool Ghash.io reached 51% mining power, causing safety concerns, but later voluntarily capped its power at 39.99% for the benefit of the whole network.[93] A few entities also dominate other parts of the ecosystem such as the client software, online wallets, and simplified payment verification (SPV) clients.[61]

Economics and usage

Bitcoin's theoretical roots and ideology
See also: Crypto-anarchism

According to the European Central Bank, the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the Austrian school of economics, especially with Friedrich von Hayek's book The Denationalization of Money, in which he advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks.[94]: 22  Sociologist Nigel Dodd, citing the crypto-anarchist Declaration of Bitcoin's Independence, argues that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as governmental, control.[95] The Economist describes bitcoin as "a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks".[96] These philosophical ideas initially attracted libertarians and anarchists.[97] Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are only used by bank skeptics and criminals.[98]

Recognition as a currency and legal status

Legal status of bitcoin
  Legal tender (bitcoin is officially recognized as a medium of exchange)
  Permissive (legal to use bitcoin, with minimal or no restrictions)
  Restricted (some legal restrictions on the usage of bitcoin)
  Contentious (interpretation of old laws, but bitcoin is not directly prohibited)
  Prohibited (full or partial prohibition on the use of bitcoin)
  No data (no information available)
vte
Money serves three purposes: a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account.[99] According to The Economist in 2014, bitcoin functions best as a medium of exchange.[99] In 2015, The Economist noted that bitcoins had three qualities useful in a currency: they are "hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify".[100] However, a 2018 assessment by The Economist stated that cryptocurrencies met none of these three criteria.[96] Per some researchers, as of 2015, bitcoin functions more as a payment system than as a currency.[24] In 2014, economist Robert J. Shiller wrote that bitcoin has potential as a unit of account for measuring the relative value of goods, as with Chile's Unidad de Fomento, but that "Bitcoin in its present form ... doesn't really solve any sensible economic problem".[101] François R. Velde, Senior Economist at the Chicago Fed, described bitcoin as "an elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency".[102] David Andolfatto, Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment, which he argues is a good thing for the Federal Reserve System and other central banks, because it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies.[103]

The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from one jurisdiction to another. Because of its decentralized nature and its global presence, regulating bitcoin is difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would constitute a de facto ban.[104] The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, and law enforcement.[105] Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that bitcoin's anonymity encourages money laundering and other crimes.[106] This is the main justification behind bitcoin bans.[10] As of November 2021, nine countries applied an absolute ban (Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia) while another 42 countries had an implicit ban.[107][needs update] Bitcoin is only legal tender in El Salvador.[4]

Use for payments

As of 2018, Bitcoin is rarely used in transactions with merchants,[108] but it is popular to purchase illegal goods online.[109][110] Prices are not usually quoted in bitcoin and trades involve conversions into fiat currencies.[24] Commonly cited reasons for not using Bitcoin include high costs, the inability to process chargebacks, high price volatility, long transaction times, and transaction fees (especially for small purchases).[108][111] Bloomberg reported that bitcoin was being used for large-item purchases on the site Overstock.com and for cross-border payments to freelancers.[112] As of 2015, there was little sign of bitcoin use in international remittances despite high fees charged by banks and Western Union who compete in this market.[24][113]

In September 2021, the Bitcoin Law made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, alongside the US dollar.[4] The adoption has been criticized both internationally and within El Salvador.[4][114] In particular, in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to reverse its decision.[115] As of 2022, the use of Bitcoin in El Salvador remains low: 80% of businesses refused to accept it despite being legally required to.[116] In April 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) adopted Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the CFA franc,[117] but repealed the reform one year later.[118]

Bitcoin is also used by some governments. For instance, the Iranian government initially opposed cryptocurrencies, but later saw them as an opportunity to circumvent sanctions.[119] Since 2020, Iran has required local bitcoin miners to sell bitcoin to the Central Bank of Iran, allowing the central bank to use it for imports.[120] Some constituent states also accept tax payments in bitcoin, including Colorado (US)[121] and Zug (Switzerland).[122] As of 2023, the US government owned more than $5 billion worth of seized bitcoin.[123][124]

Use for investment and status as an economic bubble
Further information: Cryptocurrency bubble

As of 2018, the overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions took place on cryptocurrency exchanges.[108] Since 2014, regulated bitcoin funds also allow exposure to the asset or to futures as an investment.[125][126] Individuals and companies such as the Winklevoss twins[127] and Elon Musk's companies SpaceX and Tesla have massively invested in Bitcoin.[128][129] Bitcoin wealth is highly concentrated, with 0.01% holding 27% of in-circulation currency, as of 2021.[130] As of September 2023, El Salvador had $76.5 million worth of bitcoin in its international reserves.[131]

In 2018, research published in the Journal of Monetary Economics concluded that price manipulation occurred during the Mt. Gox bitcoin theft and that the market remained vulnerable to manipulation.[132] Research published in The Journal of Finance also suggested that trading associated with increases in the amount of the Tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the Bitfinex exchange accounted for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017.[133][134]

Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an economic bubble by several economists, including Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, such as Joseph Stiglitz,[135] James Heckman,[9] and Paul Krugman.[98] Another recipient of the prize, Robert Shiller, argues that bitcoin is rather a fad that may become an asset class. He describes its price growth as an "epidemic", driven by contagious narratives.[136]

According to research published in the International Review of Financial Analysis in 2018, Bitcoin as an asset is highly volatile and does not behave like any other conventional asset.[137] According to one 2022 analysis published in The Journal of Alternative Investments, bitcoin was less volatile than oil, silver, US Treasuries, and 190 stocks in the S&P 500 during and after the 2020 stock market crash.[138] The term hodl was created in December 2013 for holding Bitcoin rather than selling it during periods of volatility.[139][140]

Economists, investors, and the central bank of Estonia have described bitcoin as a potential Ponzi scheme.[141][142][143] Legal scholar Eric Posner disagrees, however, as "a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion".[144] A 2014 World Bank report also concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme.[145]

For other uses, see Block chain (disambiguation).
A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]

A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.[7]

Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[8] however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.[4][9]

History

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin transactions per day (January 2011 – January 2021)
Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".[10] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[13]

The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[15]

The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[16]

According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[17] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain".[18] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their business.[19]

Structure and design

Blockchain formation. The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block. Orphan blocks (purple) exist outside of the main chain.
A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[3][20] This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[21] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[22] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[23] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]

Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[24]

infrastructure (hardware)
networking (node discovery, information propagation[25] and verification)
consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)
data (blocks, transactions)
application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)
Blocks
Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).[26][27] To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[28]

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[27] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[29] as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[3][30]: ch. 08 [31] For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.[32]

Block time
The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[33]

Hard forks
This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork.[edit]
A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible and requires all users to upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.

For example, Ethereum was hard forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[34]

A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin Cash.[35] The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate for demand.[36]
Decentralization
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held centrally.[3] The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.[37]

In a so-called "51% attack" a central entity gains control of more than half of a network and can then manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing double-spending.[38]

Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.[39]: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.[3]

Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive database replication[40] and computational trust. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user is "trusted" more than any other.[39] Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software. Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to validate transactions,[27] add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.[30]: ch. 08  Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.[41] Later consensus methods include proof of stake.[27] The growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.[42]

Finality
Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is "finalized") and thus can be trusted. Most distributed blockchain protocols, whether proof of work or proof of stake, cannot guarantee the finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on "probabilistic finality": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.[43]

Byzantine fault tolerance-based proof-of-stake protocols purport to provide so called "absolute finality": a randomly chosen validator proposes a block, the rest of validators vote on it, and, if a supermajority decision approves it, the block is irreversibly committed into the blockchain.[43] A modification of this method, an "economic finality", is used in practical protocols, like the Casper protocol used in Ethereum: validators which sign two different blocks at the same position in the blockchain are subject to "slashing", where their leveraged stake is forfeited.[43]

Openness
Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.[44][45][46][47][48] Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.[49] Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.[50]: 30–31  Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.[44][46] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."[8][51]

Permissionless (public) blockchain
An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed.[29] This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.[29]

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.[52] Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.

Permissioned (private) blockchain
See also: Distributed ledger
Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.[53] It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.[9]

Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain
Nikolai Hampton argued in Computerworld that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."[8] This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,[54] and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's time-consuming and expensive."[8] He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases."[8]

Blockchain analysis
The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.[55] A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and banks.[56][57] The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trading of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc.[58] A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is changing now that specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as Monero.[59][60][61]

Standardisation
In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to consider developing standards to support blockchain technology. This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.[62] The technical committee has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity, smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to industry sectors and generic government requirements.[63][non-primary source needed] More than 50 countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).[63]

Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain standards.[64] These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology[65] (NIST), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization[66] (CENELEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers[67] (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and some individual participants in the Internet Engineering Task Force[68] (IETF).

Centralized blockchain
Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and distributed, Oracle launched a centralized blockchain table feature in Oracle 21c database. The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a centralized blockchain which provide immutable feature. Compared to decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains normally can provide a higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based distributed blockchains.[69][70]

Types
Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.

Public blockchains
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).[71][self-published source?] Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a proof-of-stake or proof-of-work algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.

Private blockchains
A private blockchain is permissioned.[53] One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.

Hybrid blockchains
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.[72] The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.

Sidechains
A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.[73][74] Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).[75][better source needed]

Consortium blockchain
A consortium blockchain is a type of blockchain that combines elements of both public and private blockchains. In a consortium blockchain, a group of organizations come together to create and operate the blockchain, rather than a single entity. The consortium members jointly manage the blockchain network and are responsible for validating transactions. Consortium blockchains are permissioned, meaning that only certain individuals or organizations are allowed to participate in the network. This allows for greater control over who can access the blockchain and helps to ensure that sensitive information is kept confidential.

Consortium blockchains are commonly used in industries where multiple organizations need to collaborate on a common goal, such as supply chain management or financial services. One advantage of consortium blockchains is that they can be more efficient and scalable than public blockchains, as the number of nodes required to validate transactions is typically smaller. Additionally, consortium blockchains can provide greater security and reliability than private blockchains, as the consortium members work together to maintain the network. Some examples of consortium blockchains include Quorum and Hyperledger.[76]

Uses

Bitcoin's transactions are recorded on a publicly viewable blockchain.
Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured from proof of concept by late 2016.[52] As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology and conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back office.[77]

In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which represents an 89% increase from the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp estimated that corporate investment into blockchain technology would reach $12.4 billion by 2022.[78] Furthermore, According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world, blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030. PwC's estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicates a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.[79]

In 2019, the BBC World Service radio and podcast series Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy identified blockchain as a technology that would have far-reaching consequences for economics and society. The economist and Financial Times journalist and broadcaster Tim Harford discussed why the underlying technology might have much wider applications and the challenges that needed to be overcome.[80] His first broadcast was on June 29, 2019.

The number of blockchain wallets quadrupled to 40 million between 2016 and 2020.[81]

A paper published in 2022 discussed the potential use of blockchain technology in sustainable management.[82]

Cryptocurrencies
Main article: Cryptocurrency
Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain.

The criminal enterprise Silk Road, which operated on Tor, utilized cryptocurrency for payments, some of which the US federal government seized through research on the blockchain and forfeiture.[83]

Governments have mixed policies on the legality of their citizens or banks owning cryptocurrencies. China implements blockchain technology in several industries including a national digital currency which launched in 2020.[84] To strengthen their respective currencies, Western governments including the European Union and the United States have initiated similar projects.[85]

Smart contracts
Main article: Smart contract
Blockchain-based smart contracts are contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.[86] One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. A key feature of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party (such as a trustee) to act as an intermediary between contracting entities — the blockchain network executes the contract on its own. This may reduce friction between entities when transferring value and could subsequently open the door to a higher level of transaction automation.[87] An IMF staff discussion from 2018 reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general, but "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use, their legal status was unclear.[88][89]

Financial services
According to Reason, many banks have expressed interest in implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking and are cooperating with companies creating private blockchains;[90][91][92] according to a September 2016 IBM study, it is occurring faster than expected.[93]

Banks are interested in this technology not least because it has the potential to speed up back office settlement systems.[94] Moreover, as the blockchain industry has reached early maturity institutional appreciation has grown that it is, practically speaking, the infrastructure of a whole new financial industry, with all the implications which that entails.[95]

Banks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.[96][97]

Berenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an "overhyped technology" that has had a large number of "proofs of concept", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.[98]

The blockchain has also given rise to initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as a new category of digital asset called security token offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as digital security offerings (DSOs).[99] STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on public, regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property, real estate,[100] art, or individual products. A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.

Games
Main article: Blockchain game
Blockchain technology, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has been used in video games for monetization. Many live-service games offer in-game customization options, such as character skins or other in-game items, which the players can earn and trade with other players using in-game currency. Some games also allow for trading of virtual items using real-world currency, but this may be illegal in some countries where video games are seen as akin to gambling, and has led to gray market issues such as skin gambling, and thus publishers typically have shied away from allowing players to earn real-world funds from games.[101] Blockchain games typically allow players to trade these in-game items for cryptocurrency, which can then be exchanged for money.[102]

The first known game to use blockchain technologies was CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017, where the player would purchase NFTs with Ethereum cryptocurrency, each NFT consisting of a virtual pet that the player could breed with others to create offspring with combined traits as new NFTs.[103][102] The game made headlines in December 2017 when one virtual pet sold for more than US$100,000.[104] CryptoKitties also illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network in early 2018 with approximately 30% of all Ethereum transactions[clarification needed] being for the game.[105][106]

By the early 2020s, there had not been a breakout success in video games using blockchain, as these games tend to focus on using blockchain for speculation instead of more traditional forms of gameplay, which offers limited appeal to most players. Such games also represent a high risk to investors as their revenues can be difficult to predict.[102] However, limited successes of some games, such as Axie Infinity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and corporate plans towards metaverse content, refueled interest in the area of GameFi, a term describing the intersection of video games and financing typically backed by blockchain currency, in the second half of 2021.[107] Several major publishers, including Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Take Two Interactive, have stated that blockchain and NFT-based games are under serious consideration for their companies in the future.[108]

In October 2021, Valve Corporation banned blockchain games, including those using cryptocurrency and NFTs, from being hosted on its Steam digital storefront service, which is widely used for personal computer gaming, claiming that this was an extension of their policy banning games that offered in-game items with real-world value. Valve's prior history with gambling, specifically skin gambling, was speculated to be a factor in the decision to ban blockchain games.[109] Journalists and players responded positively to Valve's decision as blockchain and NFT games have a reputation for scams and fraud among most PC gamers,[101][109] and Epic Games, which runs the Epic Games Store in competition to Steam, said that they would be open to accepted blockchain games in the wake of Valve's refusal.[110]

Supply chain

This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (August 2023)
There have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.

Precious commodities mining — Blockchain technology has been used for tracking the origins of gemstones and other precious commodities. In 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that the blockchain technology company Everledger was partnering with IBM's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to ensure that they were ethically mined.[111] As of 2019, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has been involved in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracer.[112]
Food supply — As of 2018, Walmart and IBM were running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach – all nodes of the blockchain were administered by Walmart and located on the IBM cloud.[113]
Fashion industry — There is an opaque relationship between brands, distributors, and customers in the fashion industry, which prevents the sustainable and stable development of the fashion industry. Blockchain could make this information transparent, assisting sustainable development of the industry.[114]
Motor vehicles — Mercedes-Benz and partner Icertis developed a blockchain prototype used to facilitate consistent documentation of contracts along the supply chain so that the ethical standards and contractual obligations required of its direct suppliers can be passed on to second tier suppliers and beyond.[115][116] In another project, the company uses blockchain technology to track the emissions of climate-relevant gases and the amount of secondary material along the supply chain for its battery cell manufacturers.[117]
Domain names
There are several different efforts to offer domain name services via the blockchain. These domain names can be controlled by the use of a private key, which purports to allow for uncensorable websites. This would also bypass a registrar's ability to suppress domains used for fraud, abuse, or illegal content.[118]

Namecoin is a cryptocurrency that supports the ".bit" top-level domain (TLD). Namecoin was forked from bitcoin in 2011. The .bit TLD is not sanctioned by ICANN, instead requiring an alternative DNS root.[118] As of 2015, .bit was used by 28 websites, out of 120,000 registered names.[119] Namecoin was dropped by OpenNIC in 2019, due to malware and potential other legal issues.[120] Other blockchain alternatives to ICANN include The Handshake Network,[119] EmerDNS, and Unstoppable Domains.[118]

Specific TLDs include ".eth", ".luxe", and ".kred", which are associated with the Ethereum blockchain through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). The .kred TLD also acts as an alternative to conventional cryptocurrency wallet addresses as a convenience for transferring cryptocurrency.[121]

Other uses
Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users[122] or musicians.[123] The Gartner 2019 CIO Survey reported 2% of higher education respondents had launched blockchain projects and another 18% were planning academic projects in the next 24 months.[124] In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution.[125] Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as a blockchain-based alternative "that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians."[126][127]

New distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain.[128][129] The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers.[130] The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.[131]

Other blockchain designs include Hyperledger, a collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM).[132][133][134] Another is Quorum, a permissioned private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract applications.[135]

Oracle introduced a blockchain table feature in its Oracle 21c database.[69][70]

Blockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading.[136][137][138]

Lightweight blockchains, or simplified blockchains, are more suitable for internet of things (IoT) applications than conventional blockchains.[139] One experiment suggested that a lightweight blockchain-based network could accommodate up to 1.34 million authentication processes every second, which could be sufficient for resource-constrained IoT networks.[140]

Blockchain could be used in detecting counterfeits by associating unique identifiers to products, documents and shipments, and storing records associated with transactions that cannot be forged or altered.[141][142] It is however argued that blockchain technology needs to be supplemented with technologies that provide a strong binding between physical objects and blockchain systems,[143] as well as provisions for content creator verification ala KYC standards.[144] The EUIPO established an Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum, with the objective of "defining, piloting and implementing" an anti-counterfeiting infrastructure at the European level.[145][146] The Dutch Standardisation organisation NEN uses blockchain together with QR Codes to authenticate certificates.[147]

Beijing and Shanghai are among the cities designated by China to trial blockchain applications as January 30, 2022.[148] In Chinese legal proceedings, blockchain technology was first accepted as a method for authenticating internet evidence by the Hangzhou Internet Court in 2019 and has since been accepted by other Chinese courts.[149]: 123–125 

Blockchain interoperability
With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner[150] stated that "interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.

There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.[151] They can be classified into three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.

Several individual IETF participants produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture.[152]

Energy consumption concerns
Some cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified. This requires a large amount of energy. In June 2018, the Bank for International Settlements criticized the use of public proof-of-work blockchains for their high energy consumption.[153][154][155]

Early concern over the high energy consumption was a factor in later blockchains such as Cardano (2017), Solana (2020) and Polkadot (2020) adopting the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake model. Researchers have estimated that Bitcoin consumes 100,000 times as much energy as proof-of-stake networks.[156][157]

In 2021, a study by Cambridge University determined that Bitcoin (at 121 terawatt-hours per year) used more electricity than Argentina (at 121TWh) and the Netherlands (109TWh).[158] According to Digiconomist, one bitcoin transaction required 708 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy, the amount an average U.S. household consumed in 24 days.[159]

In February 2021, U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen called Bitcoin "an extremely inefficient way to conduct transactions", saying "the amount of energy consumed in processing those transactions is staggering".[160] In March 2021, Bill Gates stated that "Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind", adding "It's not a great climate thing."[161]

Nicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, examined blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases found it grossly inadequate.[162][163] The 31TWh-45TWh of electricity used for bitcoin in 2018 produced 17-23 million tonnes of CO2.[164][165] By 2022, the University of Cambridge and Digiconomist estimated that the two largest proof-of-work blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, together used twice as much electricity in one year as the whole of Sweden, leading to the release of up to 120 million tonnes of CO2 each year.[166]

Some cryptocurrency developers are considering moving from the proof-of-work model to the proof-of-stake model.[167]

Academic research

Blockchain panel discussion at the first IEEE Computer Society TechIgnite conference
In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.[168] Many universities have founded departments focusing on crypto and blockchain, including MIT, in 2017. In the same year, Edinburgh became "one of the first big European universities to launch a blockchain course", according to the Financial Times.[169]

Adoption decision
Motivations for adopting blockchain technology (an aspect of innovation adoption) have been investigated by researchers. For example, Janssen, et al. provided a framework for analysis,[170] and Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors.[171] Based on behavioral models, Li[172] has discussed the differences between adoption at the individual level and organizational levels.

Collaboration
Scholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration.[173][174] It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation (i.e., prevention of opportunistic behavior) and coordination (i.e., communication and information sharing). Thanks to reliability, transparency, traceability of records, and information immutability, blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms. Contrary to contracts, blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements.[175] In addition, contrary to the use of relational norms, blockchains do not require a trust or direct connections between collaborators.

Blockchain and internal audit

The need for internal audits to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that information is accessed in new formats.[177] Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain. The Institute of Internal Auditors has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology. New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks. The Internal Audit Foundation study, Blockchain and Internal Audit, assesses these factors.[178] The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain.[179]

Journals
Main article: Ledger (journal)
In September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, Ledger, was announced. The inaugural issue was published in December 2016.[180] The journal covers aspects of mathematics, computer science, engineering, law, economics and philosophy that relate to cryptocurrencies.[181][182] The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which are then timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address on the first page of their papers for non-repudiation purposes.[183]

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)[Note 1] is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for many matters related to information and communication technologies.[1] It was established on 17 May 1865 as the International Telegraph Union, significantly predating the UN and making it the oldest UN agency.[2] Doreen Bogdan-Martin is the Secretary-General of ITU, the first woman to serve as its head.

The ITU was initially aimed at helping connect telegraphic networks between countries, with its mandate consistently broadening with the advent of new communications technologies; it adopted its current name in 1932 to reflect its expanded responsibilities over radio and the telephone.[3] On 15 November 1947, the ITU entered into an agreement with the newly created United Nations to become a specialized agency within the UN system, which formally entered into force on 1 January 1949.[4]

The ITU promotes the shared global use of the radio spectrum, facilitates international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, assists in developing and coordinating worldwide technical standards, and works to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world. It is also active in the areas of broadband Internet, optical communications (including optical fiber technologies), wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, TV broadcasting, amateur radio, and next-generation networks.

Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the ITU's global membership includes 193 countries and around 900 businesses, academic institutions, and international and regional organizations.[5]

History
The ITU is one of the oldest international organizations still in operation, second[citation needed] only to the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine, which predates it by fifty years.[6][7] It was preceded by the now defunct International Telegraph Union which drafted the earliest international standards and regulations governing international telegraph networks.[8] The development of the telegraph in the early 19th century changed the way people communicated on the local and international levels. Between 1849 and 1865, a series of bilateral and regional agreements among Western European states attempted to standardize international communications.[9]

By 1865, it was agreed that a comprehensive agreement was needed in order to create a framework that would standardize telegraphy equipment, set uniform operating instructions, and lay down common international tariff and accounting rules. Between 1 March and 17 May 1865, the French Government hosted delegations from 20 European states at the first International Telegraph Conference in Paris. This meeting culminated in the International Telegraph Convention which was signed on 17 May 1865.[9][10] As a result of the 1865 Conference, the International Telegraph Union, the predecessor to the modern ITU, was founded as the first international standards organization. The Union was tasked with implementing basic principles for international telegraphy. This included: the use of the Morse code as the international telegraph alphabet, the protection of the secrecy of correspondence, and the right of everybody to use the international telegraphy.[9][11][12][13]

Another predecessor to the modern ITU, the International Radiotelegraph Union, was established in 1906 at the first International Radiotelegraph Convention in Berlin. The conference was attended by representatives of 29 nations and culminated in the International Radiotelegraph Convention. An annex to the convention eventually became known as ITU Radio Regulations. At the conference it was also decided that the Bureau of the International Telegraph Union would also act as the conference's central administrator.[10][14]

Between 3 September and 10 December 1932, a joint conference of the International Telegraph Union and the International Radiotelegraph Union convened to merge the two organizations into a single entity, the International Telecommunication Union. The Conference decided that the Telegraph Convention of 1875 and the Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927 were to be combined into a single convention, the International Telecommunication Convention, embracing the three fields of telegraphy, telephony and radio.[10][15]

On 15 November 1947, an agreement between ITU and the newly created United Nations recognized the ITU as the specialized agency for global telecommunications. This agreement entered into force on 1 January 1949, officially making the ITU an organ of the United Nations.[10][13][14]

ITU sectors
The ITU comprises three sectors, each managing a different aspect of the matters covered by the ITU, as well as ITU Telecom.[16] The sectors were created during the restructuring of ITU at the additional 1992 ITU Plenipotentiary Conference.[17][18]

Radio communication (ITU-R)
Established in 1927 as the International Radio Consultative Committee or CCIR (from its French name Comité consultatif international pour la radio), this sector manages the international radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbit resources. In 1992, the CCIR became the ITU-R. The secretariat is the Radiocommunication Bureau, headed by Director Mario Maniewicz.
Standardization (ITU-T)
Standardization has been the original purpose of ITU since its inception. Established in 1956 as the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee, or CCITT (from its French name Comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique), this sector standardizes global telecommunications (except for radio).[17] In 1993, the CCITT became the ITU-T. The standardization work is undertaken by study groups, including Study Group 13 on Networks and Study Group 16 on Multimedia, and Study Group 17 on Security. The parent body of the study groups is the quadrennial World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly. New work areas can be developed in focus groups, such as the ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health. The secretariat is the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, headed by Director Seizo Onoe.
Development (ITU-D)
Established in 1992, this sector helps spread equitable, sustainable and affordable access to information and communication technologies (ICT). It also provides the Secretariat for the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development and the Partner2Connect Digital Alliance.
A permanent General Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General, manages the day-to-day work of the ITU and its sectors.

Legal framework
The basic texts of the ITU[19] are adopted by the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference.[20] The founding document of the ITU was the 1865 International Telegraph Convention,[21][22][23]: I.B.1.8  which has since been replaced several times (though the text is generally the same)[23]: I.B.1.8  and is now entitled the "Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union".[24] In addition to the Constitution and Convention, the consolidated basic texts include the Optional Protocol on the settlement of disputes,[23]: I.B.1.8.a.1  the Decisions, Resolutions, Reports and Recommendations in force, as well as the General Rules of Conferences, Assemblies and Meetings of the Union.[citation needed
How would people react? Would they feel anger, sadness, fear…or, would they get fired up and inspired? And what would they think of the very big changes I was about to announce? Would they think that our culture, that we all are so proud of, was about to change for the worse? But I guess more than anything, I really felt for our people. I was about to challenge them, and ask a lot from them.

The presentation first highlighted the cold facts of Supercell’s performance in the last several years. We had not been able to grow our live games and had fallen behind the best companies who had done so. Furthermore, we had not released a new game since Brawl Stars in 2018. The result, I showed in detail, was Supercell falling from the #1-ranked global publisher of mobile games in 2016 to outside the Top 10 in 2023. It was painful, but honest and necessary, so that we all shared the same context. Next, I walked everyone through multiple significant changes which we believed would help Supercell improve and to close the widening gap between us and the very top-performing companies in our industry.

I would like to share those changes with you in this post, but let’s first rewind to how we came to these decisions. Something absolutely had to change, but what? How? What were the risks?

“Don’t Do It”
In last year’s blog post, I outlined Supercell’s two-pronged challenge of growing live games and simultaneously creating new ones. We were struggling with both. I was delighted to get a ton of feedback from inside and outside Supercell. I spoke to dozens of people, including founders, investors, artists, incubators, accelerators, and members of academia, to get their input. 

I was surprised that the vast majority of people spent most of their time warning me about what could go wrong if we started changing things at Supercell. In one way or another, most told me: “don’t do it.” Some implied it, others were quite direct, but the message was clear. I was also surprised that this message was more true of feedback from people outside of Supercell vs. from my colleagues inside. I would have expected the opposite.

To give you an idea, among other things, I received input such as:

“You guys are the only mobile studio that has created five billion dollar games, don’t change what is working”

“More than 200 million monthly players, half a billion in annual profits and you’re not happy??”

“Look at [great game company], they did what you’re planning to do and that was the beginning of the end. All the best people simply left.”

“Focus on live games, and take an M&A approach to acquire new games to your portfolio.”

“You will destroy what makes you unique, which is your culture.”

Nothing is closer to my heart than the people and culture we have at Supercell, so the idea that I would drive something that would destroy it…well, there are no words to describe how that would feel. Stressful doesn’t quite cover it.

At the same time, however, it was impossible to ignore the facts. The best-in-class companies grew their live games, we had not (GGWP: Dream Games, Riot Games, King, Playrix, and others). Several great new games came out and performed extremely well since we launched Brawl Stars, we had not launched any (h/t: Royal Match, Genshin Impact, Monopoly Go, CoD Mobile, and others).

With these stark facts and stressful (but invaluable) input from dozens of smart, experienced people, how could we think about what to do? I reminded myself of some key mental frameworks to help us focus:

Do we focus on the past or the future? Unless we believe Supercell’s best days are ahead of us, we shouldn’t be here anymore. We have to focus on the future.

Do we focus on things we can control or those that we cannot? This seems obvious, but it is so easy to imagine some outside force that would destroy our culture. We all own it, so it is up to us to ensure the best parts of it do not change. We have to focus on what we can control.

Do we focus on the many ways something might fail or on the few ways it might succeed? My colleagues often tell me that I’m an optimist (they’re usually much more extreme in their descriptions of me!). In my career, I have been very lucky to witness enormous successes. In each of those situations, there have been countless things that could have gone wrong and reasons why teams should have failed. However, in each instance, there was a group of people who believed in why something would work and they committed themselves to make sure it did. We have to focus on how & why we could succeed.

This mental approach gave me the necessary confidence that we were about to do the right (and responsible) thing. We owed it to our players, our community, and to everyone at Supercell, past & present. We had to improve and should not let fear of failure drive our decisions.


Two Birds, Two Stones
The leading idea behind the planned changes was what I wrote about in my previous blog post: creating a new game from scratch and running/growing a live game as a service are quite different problems. We needed different solutions for each. We would make changes to how we approach new games and live games, and we would change our leadership team as well.

New Games as Startups
At some point, I realized that the mental model we could apply to new games was something very close to home. As a serial founder/entrepreneur and as an active investor (within Supercell and on my own), I’ve seen great new innovation from startups. So I started to ask myself: what if we started to think of new game teams as their own startups, within Supercell? What helpful ideas could we apply? Turns out quite a few!

Team of Entrepreneurs:
We believe that new game teams have the best chance of success, in part, if they are started by a team of crazy ambitious, resourceful individuals who execute fast, are not afraid to take risks, and make aggressive (sometimes painful/scary) changes quickly. Honestly, we have not been rigorous enough about deciding about starting new game teams at Supercell.

Too often we have ended up with teams which have not had all the required skillsets or the team dynamics have not been what they should be when you start a crazy journey like this. Our bar should be as high as it would be for starting a new company. Going forward, we will be much more rigorous and are implementing a dedicated system/process to evaluate potential new game teams on this front.

The best part of this to me personally is that Supercell’s principle of greenlighting teams, not ideas will remain truer than ever before. NOTE: We will share exciting news in the near future about how people outside of Supercell can participate in this process and have an opportunity to become founders of one of Supercell’s next new game teams! Stay tuned.

Constraints:
These teams of entrepreneurs operate under a well-defined set of constraints, i.e., money raised or “runway,” which act as a forcing mechanism to get @!#$ done as quickly/efficiently as possible. Bottom line: you better have something great before you run out of money. This one is/was really hard for us! I started this thread feeling strongly that we absolutely need hard constraints (e.g., each new game team gets an agreed-upon budget. If they run out of money, before proving the game with players, the game is dead). Not so simple!

So many problems/scenarios to overcome: if a team wants to build a “big game,” then they arguably need a large budget, negating the feeling of a real constraint early on. OK, but what if we slice a larger budget into smaller parts/milestones (very common)? This leads to a greenlight process, which I’m honestly VERY allergic to. Many great companies work this way, but learning from my past mistakes (I created a greenlight process at my previous company) I would not like to see a process like this at Supercell. I’ve just seen too many times that game teams end up trying to please the greenlight committee vs. focusing on pleasing players and doing something that is risky and new.

Even more importantly, we found in internal discussions, this would lead to our developers feeling like they were no longer independent teams. This would undo the more central tenet of Supercell’s culture. We would have to find another way, and I believe we have our starting point, which relies on trusting that we really have the best possible team of entrepreneurs (see the point above). Also, we will ask our new game teams to commit to key timelines, milestones, and resourcing plans to reach them, and then openly share them with everyone in the company. In other words, we will replace the usual fixed budgets or greenlight processes with the pressure of transparency.

While I do not believe for a second that structures or processes would create great games (it’s the people and teams that do!), our “process” going forward will be 1) a systematic approach to forming the best teams, 2) trusting the teams, and 3) forcing the teams to operate in an environment of full transparency. Sounds simple, right? Will that be sufficient? Impossible to know yet, but we’re all committed to trying.




External Validation:
In the startup world, the common wisdom is that you want to get your product in front of real customers as soon as possible to validate the “product market fit”. In a similar fashion, new game teams must put their game in front of players as fast as possible. We have not been best-in-class at this, and our new game teams would benefit from testing their games with players earlier.

If player feedback meets/exceeds expectations, great - invest more aggressively. If not, that’s ok - now the team knows it has to pivot. Either way, it’s a good outcome! Problems arise if/when new game teams wait too long to get player feedback and it feels too hard or too late to change course. That’s the worst outcome for everyone.

Note: I don’t believe you create hit games by asking players what they want, but I do believe you have to show them early and face the reality of their feedback. We will implement this thinking for new game teams at Supercell, encouraging and challenging new game teams to test games with players earlier and asking them to share this plan openly with everyone at the company as per the transparency principle outlined above.

Distraction-Free Environment:
Early-stage startups face one set of distractions in the form of everything it takes to start & run a company. New teams within large companies face a different set of distractions, in the form of all the natural processes and “noise” that come from being a part of an organization of hundreds if not thousands of people (Supercell is now 550+ people). We want new game teams at Supercell to avoid both!

Being a part of Supercell means new game teams don’t need to worry about legal, HR, payroll, taxes, real estate, IT, etc. - everything that it takes to start and run a company. However, we also want new game teams to be able to focus and avoid the distractions of a large organization. That means being able to minimize company-level activities such as recruiting, internal events, selecting internal comms and slack channels, etc. We are either removing elements or making them optional for new game teams.

As an extreme example, one new game team decided to move out of our main office into their own little space nearby. We had similar discussions regarding technology. While all 5 of Supercell’s global games were built using our internal proprietary engine/tools, new game teams can choose to use whatever they want in early stages of prototyping and proof of concept. We have new game teams using Unity, Unreal, or other tools to help them move as fast as possible to see if they have created something players love. Again, getting external validation as fast as possible is key.


Our goal here is to make Supercell the best place for the best teams to create the best new games. We want this place to be better than your own startup, which sets a very high bar. But we are doing everything in our control to make that a reality and have a lot going on for us. At Supercell, you don’t need to worry about building a company and everything that comes along with it, all you need to worry about is building a great game. I know this is a never-ending effort and we will continue to change and improve in the coming months and years.


Live Games as Scaleups
Once startups have found the so-called “product market fit” (which in my mind means that they’ve been able to develop something that their customers love), they move on to the next phase which is all about making sure as many customers as possible get to use their product/service, while simultaneously making the product/service better. If startups get to this phase, they become “scaleups”. This scaling phase is very different and requires a different type of thinking. I believe the same applies to games and we would benefit from taking in some lessons from the scaleups.

At Supercell, we have found “product market fit” with five different games. These days, 200M+ players play our games every month. Clash of Clans has generated over $10B in revenue in the last decade. With Clash Royale, the World of Clash has generated more than $14B in revenue. Brawl Stars, Hay Day, and Boom Beach are each way more than billion dollar revenue earners. These are enormous businesses…yet we haven’t been treating them like they are! I’ve written about this in the past, but at Supercell, we had completely overlooked this aspect of our company. For years, we did not realise the full potential of our great games because we frankly liked our small teams so much. If someone from the outside came to visit the Clash of Clans team some years back, it looked like a prototype team to them!

We are lucky to be in our situation where Supercell teams have created 5 amazing games. The question facing us now (which we have always faced) is how do we make each game even better by adding new content and features, and bringing it to hundreds of millions (or actually billions) of people? 

The following sounds so obvious looking back that I feel like an idiot writing this (and many have probably called me an idiot on this topic!), but we can do what we do only because of our players and we should do everything in our control to make our games better for them, even if it means our teams should be bigger. Players couldn't care less how big or small our teams are, all they care about is to be able to play a great game. And if it requires a bigger team, then it is our problem to figure out how to make that bigger team work for us.

For many of us, bigger teams were scary in the beginning because they require a bit more structure and process, even “middle management” which has been a curse word at Supercell for years. But now that we have operated with these new, bigger teams for some time, we’ve realised that not all of that is bad. In fact, it can be great. First of all, with bigger teams we can do more for our players which is a great feeling in the first place. Second, if you get the structure right, it actually helps people to focus and be able to do better work.

Supercell has always been about these independent teams that we call cells. Basically, what we did here was to redefine what a live game cell is, and this time we embedded all the critical skillsets (also outside game development) into it. We started to think of them as their own “companies”, with their own leadership teams and such. These “game units” have started to grow in size. We are still nowhere near the size of some other game teams in our business which can be 500+ people in size, so we are still talking less than 100 people (so far). 

We are also experimenting with different ways to organise ourselves within these bigger teams. One of the ideas that we are currently trying is what we call “sub-cells”, which is just a new version of our cell model. It is exactly what it sounds like: the large independent game cell with one common mission is split into several sub-cells, all of which contribute to the overall mission of the larger cell.

It is a journey, and we are taking the first steps, but can already see the benefits for our players. We’ve never been able to do as much for them as we wanted, and from here, it will only get better.

Note: Because we are growing our game teams, we have been on a faster hiring pace than ever before. We are also starting to hire in several locations in Europe outside of Helsinki, which is new for us. I appreciate that 2023 and 2024 have been difficult years for video game companies, with a lot of layoffs and even closures. Our open jobs are a drop in the bucket compared to the number of jobs lost, but hopefully, with some other studios, also hiring, we can create some positive momentum in our industry.


One Culture
Given all the changes, an important question emerged: does this create two very different cultures between New and Live game teams, and will that tear the company apart? My answer is only if we let it happen, and we should not let it happen.

At its core, Supercell’s culture has always been about the idea of independent cells, each cell being responsible for their decisions. That means we have always had different ways of working between the cells. We see this diversity as a feature, not a bug. If everyone at Supercell applies this understanding, then these changes actually serve to double down on the original idea of why we founded Supercell.

That said, we should not kid ourselves. This IS a big change to everyday work. There are more people in the company, you cannot possibly know everyone anymore, there is more structure in the bigger live game units, etc. And there will definitely be big differences in how live game units work compared to new game teams.

Simultaneously, we are VERY aware of the risks of a rapidly growing headcount, and are having constant and active discussions around proactively managing it — we want to be careful to only fill the needs we have, but avoid growing uncontrollably and losing ourselves in the process. True, we have had some gaps that haven’t been filled for long. However, we also need to be extremely mindful that it takes time to really onboard and integrate people to Supercell, and our ways of working, while also learning from the new joiners.

But despite all of that, we are still one Supercell, with one culture. As we grow, there might be more ways of working, but ultimately we’re rooted in the same values and ambitions: creating the best games that would entertain as many people as possible and which would last for decades and more.


New Leadership Team - A Force Multiplier
As I was thinking about all of this, and having all these discussions, I also recognized that if I really wanted Supercell to change, we needed everyone to take ownership and accountability. That responsibility and setting that example starts with me. Any mistakes and flaws in our thinking were ultimately my mistakes, not anyone else’s. And if Supercell wanted to become better, it would need to start with me and my team, which is the leadership team.

Returning to my presentation at the offsite last August. I spoke very openly about my feelings and mistakes to everyone at the company. I told them how I had failed as the lead of my team, and also putting together the best possible team in place. At Supercell, when we fail (or succeed), we celebrate the learnings that come out of that with champagne. I am not sure if it was the champagne, but speaking openly about these mistakes actually helped me feel much better. Also, it was incredible to get the support from Supercellians at that moment. It meant the world to me.


Anyway, for this next chapter of Supercell, I wanted to surround myself with people who have seen what we are experiencing right now and have helped companies successfully navigate these challenges before. That’s why I started to rebuild the leadership team, and after a loooong search was able to convince Sara (our new Head of Live Games) and Fernanda (our new CMO) to join us. It was not easy to find these two because I needed leaders who not only had been successful at running things at scale, but also people who understood Supercell’s culture and what was great about it. I feel very, very lucky that they have joined us! 

While I am extremely happy and proud about the new leadership team that we now have here, I want to make something very clear. Supercell has never been, and is not, about the leadership. Not old or new. I have always disliked the tendency of the corporate world to turn CEOs and founders into these hero figures who come in and save the world. I want Supercell to be different. My proudest moments at Supercell have always been the ones where something amazing has happened, and I have had nothing to do with it and in fact have been the last one to hear about it. There have been many, many moments like that in the history of our company and that is what defines the Supercell culture and the magic around it to me.

So Supercell is all about our great people, teams and culture. Not about any single individual or individuals. We succeed or fail depending on how great our teams are and whether we have been able to create a culture where these teams can do their best work. And this is where the leadership team can help: I see it as a force multiplier which, if successful, can make Supercell the place where the best people can do the best work of their careers.


Journey
So, we’ve now been on this journey for a while. It is a cliche but a journey it really is, and this is just the beginning of it. Some of the changes we have made will prove to be the right ones, others will prove to be wrong ones. But that’s ok, as long as we learn from them quickly and then change them for the better. 

I told Supercellians that from now on, we should all start to think change as something that is a constant. Yes, sometimes change can feel uncomfortable. But we need to get comfortable feeling uncomfortable. We should think of change as a positive thing, something we need to do all the time to become better. As long as we change for the better every day, and can do that over a decade or two, with some luck, eventually we will land to a great place.

Financial Results
And of course, we’ve got our annual financials, which Finnish law requires us to publish, and which we have shared here for quite some time now with some commentary.

Before I get to the actual results from last year, I want to explain how we think about financial results in general. We see them as something that enables us to do more of what we’re passionate about. We have been lucky to be very profitable for years now, which is important because it enables us to take a very long term view on everything, including keeping the quality bar for our games very high and enabling us to try new risky things.

However, we don’t see financial results as the end goal but just means to the end, which is to create better games for our players. The financial results are an important signal, however, as to whether we are doing a good job for our players. If we're not creating content and experiences that players feel are worth paying for, then bluntly put we're not creating good enough content and experiences. 

It is important to emphasize that we did not expect that none of the changes I described above would have any impact on these results. We are still very much in building mode. If we are successful in this, the results will follow, but it will take some time.

All of that said, here are the financial results: 

Revenue of €1.7bn  (down 4.2% compared to 2022)

EBITDA of €580m (down 8.2% compared to 2022)

Corporate taxes of €110m paid in Finland 

There are two quite different stories behind these figures. The obvious one is that our games declined during the first half of 2023 as the mobile games market overall has continued to decline. The other one is that for our live games, every quarter last year was better than the one before it, and right now we are on a strong growth trajectory. The most shining example of this is Brawl Stars, which more than tripled its player base since last summer and, as I'm writing this, it in fact was the biggest Supercell game as measured by number of players! The reason is, quite simply, that we have been able to do more for our players in terms of creating new content and features to our games. As I said above, we take a very long term view on the changes I described above, and we are very much in building mode, but that said I have been positively surprised that it is already starting to show in the results.


Looking Ahead
At the time of writing this, it is already February 2024, and I thought I would close with a few thoughts about this coming year. To summarize my feelings, I cannot recall when was the last time we had started a new year from such a great position as we have this year. 

First of all, we have bigger and better teams than we have ever had. As a result, we can do more for our players than ever before. It is important to note that most of these bigger teams have been in place only for 1-2 update cycles. So I’d like to think this is just the beginning, and I am extremely excited to see what these teams will do for our games and players as they become better and better at working together in this new setup.

Second, I am incredibly excited about our new games for this year. Some of you have probably played Clash Mini, Squad Busters and mo.co, which are all still in development but of which we are very proud of. And there is more coming! But more about them a bit later, hopefully in the not too distant future! :)

Finally, I wanted ty
● /dev/sda, /dev/VolGroup/LogicalVolume
● Once the work-in-progress in-kernel aio interface goes
to mainline (Zach Brown and Dave Kleikamp)
● it's easy to support raw file based image
● No migration support

● Jens' multiqueue linux block layer <-> multiqueue virtio
● More performance test and analysis
● Different storage configurations / workload
